# Closed-loop Mobility E2E

Status: 0.4 target suite contract.

```bash
./test/e2e/kind/mobility/run.sh
```

The product Controller must create and advance the Move. Tests may inject API, process, node, network and
filesystem failures, but must not patch a successful status or perform the product copy/purge from the host.

## Preconditions

- source and destination Pools have fresh, valid, complete inventory
- Volume is Ready, RWO Filesystem, and has one exact owner
- workload selector, affinity, taints/tolerations and PDB permit a destination
- source publication can quiesce without an in-flight NodePublish race

An unsatisfied preflight preserves the same consumer UID and data and creates no filesystem effect.

## Transaction evidence

```text
source publish fence
  -> observed empty publication fence
  -> destination capacity hold
  -> partial copy + full verification
  -> destination promotion
  -> owner CAS
  -> actual destination publish proof
  -> source cleanup intent/effect/API receipt
  -> later generation-fenced absence proof
  -> source hold release and terminal Move
```

| Fault boundary | Required result after node/process recovery |
|---|---|
| Before owner CAS | Source remains owner; retry or recovery returns to source |
| Owner CAS response lost | Read-back determines the side of commit; never guess |
| After owner CAS | Destination remains owner; only forward convergence |
| Partial copy / checksum failure | No promotion; source and both holds remain safe |
| Destination unavailable postcommit | Before cleanup effect the source is preserved; after effect/receipt, settlement and hold release wait |
| Source unavailable postcommit | Destination serves; cleanup resumes when source returns |
| Unlink before receipt | Exact prior intent reconstructs result and later absence proof closes cleanup |
| Stale/invalid/incomplete scan | No promote, purge, completion or hold release |
| Identity contradiction | Move `Blocked` or cleanup `NeedsReview`; no destructive transition |

## Assertions

Each case validates:

1. unchanged PVC UID, PV and CSI volume handle
2. exactly one metadata owner and no dual writable mount
3. authoritative payload plus hardlink/symlink/FIFO/UID/GID/mode/sparse/ACL/xattr semantics
4. exact Pool/Volume/Move/copy/operation identities
5. correct source and destination capacity holds at every boundary
6. parent journal/finalizer persistence across Controller, helper and node restart
7. no source purge before actual destination publication
8. API purge receipt and a later fresh absence proof before completion
9. no parentless executor or unexplained physical copy after terminal success/recovery

Permanent loss of the authoritative disk/node is not a recovery-success scenario. The suite must show a safe,
observable wait or review state without inventing another owner.
